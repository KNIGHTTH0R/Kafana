# Kafana
Pilot project - Website/application for restaurants and lounge bars (using: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase).

If you want to take a look, you will need to open it with Live Server (the port should be 5500). 
If you don’t know how, take the next steps:
   - Install Visual Studio Code
   - Open the folder “Kafana” in Visual Studio Code
   - Install the extension “Live Server”
   - Open the file “intex” (right click on intex.html) with Live Server (the port should be 5500)
   
Enjoy ;)
